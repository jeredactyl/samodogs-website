        Explore dog-friendly trails in the Santa Monica Mountains using our
        interactive map.

      <p>
        The interactive trail map on the webpage is hosted on CalTopo
        (caltopo.com). When you open the map through CalTopo, you'll gain access
        to a suite of navigation tools that allow you to search for specific
        locations within the mountains and even select your current location.
        This functionality makes it easier to plan your outdoor adventures and
        explore dog-friendly trails in the Santa Monica Mountains. Additionally,
        if you notice any mistakes on the map or believe that additional
        information should be included, thereâ€™s an option to provide your
        feedback by submitting it through this
        <a
          href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfY6rdjqzHWGoH7eROSGFYYso510GsBt5wha2lQWa2HvlFCCg/viewform?usp=dialog"
          >contact form</a
        >. This ensures that the map remains as accurate and useful as possible
        for everyone.
