        <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb"></i> Tips for Hiking Responsibly with
        Your Dog
      </h2>
      <p>
        Responsible hiking ensures that our natural spaces remain pristine and
        enjoyable for everyone. Follow these key practices:
      </p>

      <h3>Plan Ahead and Prepare</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Verify Pet Policies:</strong> Confirm dog permissions and
          review park regulations before heading out. Note that rules may vary
          between agencies and specific parks, so be sure to check the
          guidelines for the area you plan to visit.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Equip Your Dog:</strong> Bring proper gear, and pack
          sufficient water for both you and your dog. Remember, dogs get hotter
          more quickly than humans because they are closer to the
          ground‚Äîconsider a portable water bowl and extra water.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Choose Less Busy Times:</strong> Hike during off-peak hours to
          minimize environmental impact.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be Aware and Considerate:</strong> Familiarize yourself with
          the trail and surroundings, and be mindful of other trail users who
          might be uncomfortable around dogs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wildlife and Hazard Awareness:</strong> In areas such as the
          Santa Monica Mountains, be aware of local hazards like rattlesnakes.
          Consider training your dog in rattlesnake aversion and other safety
          measures to better handle wildland conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Dispose of Waste Properly</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Always Pack It Out:</strong> Carry and dispose of pet waste
          responsibly. This practice is essential not only for trail etiquette
          but also to prevent the spread of pathogens.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use Waste Bags:</strong> Use the provided poop bags at
          trailheads and ensure you pack out all waste.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Keep Your Dog on a Leash and Under Control</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Follow Leash Rules:</strong> Use a leash of six feet or less
          to keep your dog under control. Even well-trained dogs can be
          overwhelmed by the sights, sounds, and scents of wildland habitats.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Protects Your Dog:</em> Helps prevent dangerous encounters
              (for example, nose-to-nose meetings with rattlesnakes, getting
              kicked by startled horses, falls, or exposure to skunks, ticks,
              fleas, and poisonous plants).
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Protects Other Trail Users:</em> Reduces the risk of your dog
              approaching, scaring, or tripping other hikers, bicyclists, or
              even small children.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Protects the Environment and Wildlife:</em> Limits your dog‚Äôs
              ability to chase or harass wildlife such as rabbits, squirrels,
              birds, and lizards. Keeping your dog leashed also minimizes
              disturbances that could lead to altered habitat use by native
              animals or the spread of diseases and parasites.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stay on the Trail:</strong> Keep your dog on the designated
          trail at all times and never allow it to chase wildlife.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Encourage Positive Interactions:</strong> A well-controlled,
          leashed dog helps create a respectful environment for both your pet
          and other visitors.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Enjoy your hike and have a great day with your dog!</p>
