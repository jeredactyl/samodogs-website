      <p>
        While our pets bring joy to our outdoor adventures, dogs can have
        significant effects on the natural environment – affecting both wildlife
        and themselves. Below you’ll find two sections that explain the risks:
      </p>

      <!-- PART 1: Impacts on Wildlife -->
      <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-leaf"></i> Risks to Wildlife from Dogs</h2>
      <p>
        Uncontrolled dog behavior and off-trail activities can disrupt wildlife
        in many ways. Even well-intended outings may trigger stress, alter
        natural behaviors, or introduce diseases to native species. Consider the
        following aspects:
      </p>

      <!-- Wildlife Impact Subsections -->
      <h3>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-tree"></i> Wildlife Stress and Habitat Disturbance
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fear Responses:</strong> Many animals perceive dogs as
          predators, causing them to flee.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Persistent Stress:</strong> Frequent disturbances reduce
          wildlife feeding, resting, and breeding opportunities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Habitat Abandonment:</strong> Areas with a high dog presence
          show decreased wildlife activity.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
        Predation Risks and Disturbance Effects
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Direct Harm:</strong> Off-leash dogs may chase, harass, or
          even injure wildlife, especially vulnerable young or nesting animals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flushing and Avoidance:</strong> Wildlife often flee at
          greater distances when disturbed off designated trails—incurring extra
          energy costs.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i>
        Risks on Undesignated Trails
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Increased Harassment:</strong> Dogs on off-trail routes can
          provoke stronger disturbance reactions since these areas are less
          predictable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Predation or Injury:</strong> The unpredictable movement of
          off-leash dogs can inadvertently trigger chase instincts, causing
          injury to both wildlife and dogs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Displacement:</strong> Wildlife may avoid off-trail areas used
          for foraging, resting, or breeding.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Disease & Parasite Transmission:</strong> Off-trail
          interactions increase the likelihood of spreading pathogens and
          parasites.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Habitat Damage:</strong> Uncontrolled movements off designated
          trails can lead to trampling of vegetation and soil disturbance in
          sensitive areas.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-virus"></i>
        Disease Transmission & Environmental Contamination
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Direct Transmission:</strong> Dogs can directly transmit
          pathogens such as Canine distemper virus (CDV), rabies, and parvovirus
          during close encounters.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Environmental Contamination:</strong> Infected dog waste
          contaminates soil and waterways, indirectly exposing wildlife to
          pathogens.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Parasite Vectors:</strong> Dogs may carry ticks, fleas, and
          other parasites that spread diseases.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <i class="fa-solid fa-binoculars"></i>
        Wildlife in the Santa Monica Mountains
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Western Bluebird:</strong> Easily disturbed during nesting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>California Newt:</strong> Particularly vulnerable near stream
          habitats.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gray Fox:</strong> Sensitive to disturbances caused by
          off-leash dogs.

      </ul>

      <!-- PART 2: Risks to Dogs -->
      <h2>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-dog"></i> Risks to Dogs from Not Following the
        Rules in the Mountains
      </h2>
      <p>
        Beyond the impact on local wildlife, failing to follow trail rules in
        the Santa Monica Mountains puts dogs at significant risk. Even when dogs
        are on designated trails, many hazards remain—and these multiply with
        off-leash or off-trail activity.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-shield"></i>
        The Safety of Your Dog Matters, Too
      </h3>
      <p>
        Responsible hiking helps protect your dog. In the Santa Monica
        Mountains, hazardous plants (like Common Yarrow, Castor Bean, Milkweed,
        and Groundsels) and animals such as rattlesnakes present real dangers.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-walking"></i>
        Trail Hazards and Off-Trail Risks for Dogs
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Rattlesnake Encounters:</strong> Off-leash dogs, particularly
          when roaming off-trail, are more likely to be bitten.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ticks and Fleas:</strong> Exposure to the outdoors increases
          the risk of parasitic infestations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Poison Oak:</strong> Dogs can pick up toxic oils that may harm
          them—and later affect their owners.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lack of Water:</strong> Dehydration is a constant danger,
          especially in remote or rugged areas.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Additional Off-Leash Hazards:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Uncontrolled dogs might engage in dangerous chases with wildlife
              or other animals.
            </li>
            <li>
              Off-trail excursions expose dogs to uneven terrain, increasing
              risks of falls or injuries.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conflicts with horses, other dogs, or bicyclists can lead to
              serious injuries.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
